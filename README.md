## webpack-dashboard-babel

A barebones example of how to use `webpack-dashboard` with `babel@7` and `create-react-app`.

To see the dashboard running and launch the app on `http://localhost:3000`, simply:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

`webpack-dashboard` should now be running your terminal and look something like the following:

This project was created using `create-react-app` and running `yarn eject` to expose the `build`, `start`, and `test` scripts, along with `webpack.config.js`.
